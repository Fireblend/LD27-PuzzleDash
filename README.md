Puzzle Dash: A Ludum Dare 27 game
===============

A repo to hold my Ludum Dare 27 Entry, which I've named **Puzzle Dash**, after the original competition's theme, "*10 seconds*". 
For now, this is an Android game. An HTML5 and Desktop versions are pending :)

You can download a jar you can play on your PC from the submission's LD page, although I discourage it simply because it's so much more fun on a multitouch screen :)

Use 2 fingers to navigate the game area, and 1 finger to clear paths of same-colored blocks!

You have only 10 seconds to clear enough blocks and make it back to the "10 secs!" button to get another 10 seconds.

There are some items hidden in the game are. Find out what they do!

About Ludum Dare

About the Ludum Dare (from Wikipedia):

Ludum Dare (from Latin "to give a game") is also known as LD48, and is an accelerated game development competition. It was founded by Geoff Howland and was first held in April 2002. Participants are given 48 hours to create a game from scratch fitting a theme announced at the start of the contest. All of the code and content must be created during the 48 hours, each entry must be created by a single person and source code must be shown. After the competition ends, participants are given 3 weeks to play and rate games created by their peers. There are no physical or cash prizes but participants retain full ownership of their entries.

This is the first time I participate on the Ludum Dare (and also first time using LibGDX).
